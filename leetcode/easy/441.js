/* You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a
staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

Example 2:
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.*/

/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}

var arrangeCoins = function(n) {
  if (!n) return 0
  let result = 0
  let total = 0

  while(total <= n) {
    result++
    total += result
  }
  if (result <= 1) return result
  return result - 1
};

console.log(arrangeCoins(5), 2)
console.log(arrangeCoins(8), 3)
